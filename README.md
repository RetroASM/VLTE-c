# VLTE

VLTE (Vim Like Text Editor) is a minimal proof of concept editor that
is simple enough to be implemented in assembly. But why?

I want to recreat what Ken Thompson did in 1969 and create a text
editor from scratch that I could use to write a simple programming language
that I could use to create yet again a simple operating system.

For now this text editor is written in Zig to layout what needs to be
implemented so I can have a roadmap. (This may be cheating since in 1969
you wouldn't have the luxury of doing this)
